                    <p>
                        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious
                        disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
                        Most people infected with the virus will experience 
                        mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without 
                        requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously 
                        ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with 
                        underlying medical conditions like <mark>cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
                        chronic respiratory disease, or cancer</mark> are more likely to develop serious 
                        illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die 
                        at any age.

                       The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to 
                       be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. 
                       Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 
                       1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and 
                       washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. 
                       Get vaccinated when itâ€™s your turn and follow local guidance.
