            Venus is the second planet from the
            Sun and is often called Earth's 
            "sister planet" due to their 
            similar size and mass. However, 
            it's also known as the hottest
            planet in our solar system. Venus
            has a thick atmosphere that 
            traps heat, resulting in extreme 
            surface temperatures.
