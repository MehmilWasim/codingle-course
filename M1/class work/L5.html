                <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    he dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus
                    familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of
                    the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog,
                    it was selectively bred from an extinct population
                    of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.
                    The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans,
                    over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.
                   Due to  their   assosian with humans, dogs have gained the ability to
                thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

                        Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, 
                        and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size,
                         and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception 
                         of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and 
                         well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared
                          to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing,
                           but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans,
                            such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship,
                             therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.
