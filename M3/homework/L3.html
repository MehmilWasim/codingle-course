            <blockquote>
                <p>There are two powers in the world; one is the sword 
                    and the other is the pen. There is a great competition 
                    and rivalry between the two. There is a third power 
                    stronger than both, that of the women. 
                    (Speech at Islamia College for women March 25, 1940.)</p>
